<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small">What Is a Desert?</span></h2>
<p>Approximately one-third of the Earth&rsquo;s land
surface is desert, arid land with meager
rainfall that supports only sparse vegetation
and a limited population of people and
animals. Deserts&mdash;stark, sometimes mysterious
worlds&mdash;have been portrayed as fascinating environments
of adventure and exploration from
narratives such as that of Lawrence of Arabia to
movies such as &ldquo;Dune.&rdquo; These arid regions are
called <i>deserts</i> because they are dry. They may
be hot, they may be cold. They may be regions
of sand or vast areas of rocks and gravel peppered
with occasional plants. But deserts are
always dry.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Deserts are natural laboratories in which to
study the interactions of wind and sometimes
water on the arid surfaces of planets. They contain
valuable mineral deposits that were formed
in the arid environment or that were exposed by
erosion. Because deserts are dry, they are ideal
places for human artifacts and fossils to be preserved.
Deserts are also fragile environments.
The misuse of these lands is a serious and growing
problem in parts of our world.</p>

<p class="center">[<a href="images/map_hr.jpg">Higher-resolution map</a>]</p>
<p>There are almost as many definitions of deserts
and classification systems as there are deserts in
the world. Most classifications rely on some combination
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
of the number of days of rainfall, the total
amount of annual rainfall, temperature, humidity,
or other factors. In 1953, Peveril Meigs divided
desert regions on Earth into three categories according
to the amount of precipitation they received.
In this now widely accepted system, extremely
arid lands have at least 12 consecutive
months without rainfall, arid lands have less than
250 millimeters of annual rainfall, and semiarid
lands have a mean annual precipitation of between
250 and 500 millimeters. Arid and extremely
arid land are deserts, and semiarid
grasslands generally are referred to as steppes.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small">How the Atmosphere Influences Aridity</span></h2>
<p>We live at the bottom of a gaseous
envelope&mdash;the atmosphere&mdash;that is
bound gravitationally to the planet
Earth. The circulation of our atmosphere is a
complex process because of the Earth&rsquo;s rotation
and the tilt of its axis. The Earth&rsquo;s axis is inclined
23&frac12;&deg; from the ecliptic, the plane of the
Earth&rsquo;s orbit around the Sun. Due to this inclination,
vertical rays of the Sun strike 23&frac12;&deg; N.
latitude, the Tropic of Cancer, at summer solstice
in late June. At winter solstice, the vertical
rays strike 23&frac12;&deg; S. latitude, the Tropic of Capricorn.
In the Northern Hemisphere, the summer
solstice day has the most daylight hours, and the
winter solstice has the fewest daylight hours
each year. The tilt of the axis allows differential
heating of the Earth&rsquo;s surface, which causes
seasonal changes in the global circulation.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_6">
<img src="images/p010.jpg" alt="The circulation pattern of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Most of the nonpolar deserts lie within the two trade winds belts." width="500" height="523" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">The circulation pattern of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Most of the nonpolar deserts lie within the two trade winds belts.</span></p>
</div>
<p>On a planetary scale, the circulation of air between
the hot Equator and the cold North and
South Poles creates pressure belts that influence
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
weather. Air warmed by the Sun rises at the Equator,
cools as it moves toward the poles, descends
as cold air over the poles, and warms again as it
moves over the surface of the Earth toward the
Equator. This simple pattern of atmospheric convection,
however, is complicated by the rotation
of the Earth, which introduces the Coriolis Effect.</p>
<p>To appreciate the origin of this effect, consider
the following. A stick placed vertically in the
ground at the North Pole would simply turn
around as the Earth rotates. A stick at the
Equator would move in a large circle of almost
40,000 kilometers with the Earth as it rotates.</p>
<p>The Coriolis Effect illustrates Newton&rsquo;s first law
of motion&mdash;a body in motion will maintain its
speed and direction of motion unless acted on by
some outside force. Thus, a wind travelling north
from the equator will maintain the velocity acquired
at the equator while the Earth under it is
moving slower. This effect accounts for the generally
east-west direction of winds, or streams of
air, on the Earth&rsquo;s surface. Winds blow between
areas of different atmospheric pressures.</p>
<p>The Coriolis Effect influences the circulation
pattern of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. In the zone
between about 30&deg; N. and 30&deg; S., the surface air
flows toward the Equator and the flow aloft is
poleward. A low-pressure area of calm, light
variable winds near the equator is known to
mariners as the <i>doldrums</i>.</p>
<p>Around 30&deg; N. and S., the poleward flowing air
begins to descend toward the surface in subtropical
high-pressure belts. The sinking air is relatively
dry because its moisture has already been
released near the Equator above the tropical rain
forests. Near the center of this high-pressure zone
of descending air, called the &ldquo;Horse Latitudes,&rdquo;
the winds at the surface are weak and variable.
The name for this area is believed to have been
given by colonial sailors, who, becalmed sometimes
at these latitudes while crossing the oceans
with horses as cargo, were forced to throw a few
horses overboard to conserve water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The surface air that flows from these subtropical
high-pressure belts toward the Equator is deflected
toward the west in both hemispheres by the
Coriolis Effect. Because winds are named for the
direction from which the wind is blowing, these
winds are called the northeast trade winds in the
Northern Hemisphere and the southeast trade
winds in the Southern Hemisphere. The trade
winds meet at the doldrums. Surface winds known
as &ldquo;westerlies&rdquo; flow from the Horse Latitudes toward
the poles. The &ldquo;westerlies&rdquo; meet &ldquo;easterlies&rdquo;
from the polar highs at about 50-60&deg; N. and S.</p>
<p>Near the ground, wind direction is affected by
friction and by changes in topography. Winds
may be seasonal, sporadic, or daily. They range
from gentle breezes to violent gusts at speeds
greater than 300 kilometers/hour.</p>

the Earth. The deserts of our world are
not restricted by latitude, longitude, or elevation.
They occur from areas close to the poles down
to areas near the Equator. The People&rsquo;s Republic
of China has both the highest desert, the Qaidam
Depression that is 2,600 meters above sea level,
and one of the lowest deserts, the Turpan
Depression that is 150 meters below sea level.</p>
<p>Deserts are not confined to Earth. The atmospheric
circulation patterns of other terrestrial planets
with gaseous envelopes also depend on the
rotation of those planets, the tilts of their axes,
their distances from the Sun, and the composition
and density of their atmospheres. Except for
the poles, the entire surface of Mars is a desert.
Venus also may support deserts.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><br /><span class="small">Types of Deserts</span></h2>
<p>Deserts are classified by their geographical
location and dominant weather pattern as
<i>trade wind</i>, <i>midlatitude</i>, <i>rain shadow</i>,
<i>coastal</i>, <i>monsoon</i>, or <i>polar</i> deserts. Former desert
areas presently in nonarid environments are
<i>paleodeserts</i>, and <i>extraterrestrial</i> deserts exist on
other planets.</p>
<h3 id="c5">Trade wind deserts</h3>
<p>The trade winds in two belts on the equatorial
sides of the Horse Latitudes heat up as they
move toward the Equator. These dry winds dissipate
cloud cover, allowing more sunlight to
heat the land. Most of the major deserts of the
world lie in areas crossed by the trade winds.
The world&rsquo;s largest desert, the Sahara of North
Africa, which has experienced temperatures as
high as 57&deg; C, is a trade wind desert.</p>
<h3 id="c6">Midlatitude deserts</h3>
<p>Midlatitude deserts occur between 30&deg; and 50&deg;
N. and S., poleward of the subtropical high-pressure
zones. These deserts are in interior
drainage basins far from oceans and have a
wide range of annual temperatures. The Sonoran
Desert of southwestern North America is a
typical midlatitude desert.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Rain shadow deserts</h3>
<p>Rain shadow deserts are formed because tall
mountain ranges prevent moisture-rich clouds
from reaching areas on the lee, or protected
side, of the range. As air rises over the mountain,
water is precipitated and the air loses its
moisture content. A desert is formed in the leeside
&ldquo;shadow&rdquo; of the range.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h3 id="c8">Coastal deserts</h3>
<p>Coastal deserts generally are found on the
western edges of continents near the Tropics of
Cancer and Capricorn. They are affected by cold
ocean currents that parallel the coast. Because
local wind systems dominate the trade winds,
these deserts are less stable than other deserts.
Winter fogs, produced by upwelling cold currents,
frequently blanket coastal deserts and block solar
radiation. Coastal deserts are relatively complex
because they are at the juncture of terrestrial,
oceanic, and atmospheric systems. A coastal
desert, the Atacama of South America, is the
Earth&rsquo;s driest desert. In the Atacama, measurable
rainfall&mdash;1 millimeter or more of rain&mdash;may
occur as infrequently as once every 5-20 years.</p>

<h3 id="c9">Monsoon deserts</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Monsoon,&rdquo; derived from an Arabic word for
&ldquo;season,&rdquo; refers to a wind system with pronounced
seasonal reversal. Monsoons develop in
response to temperature variations between continents
and oceans. The southeast trade winds
of the Indian Ocean, for example, provide heavy
summer rains in India as they move onshore. As
the monsoon crosses India, it loses moisture on
the eastern slopes of the Aravalli Range. The
Rajasthan Desert of India and the Thar Desert of
Pakistan are parts of a monsoon desert region
west of the range.</p>

<h3 id="c10">Polar deserts</h3>
<p>Polar deserts are areas with annual precipitation
less than 250 millimeters and a mean
temperature during the warmest month of less
than 10&deg; C. Polar deserts on the Earth cover
nearly 5 million square kilometers and are mostly
bedrock or gravel plains. Sand dunes are not
prominent features in these deserts, but snow
dunes occur commonly in areas where precipitation
is locally more abundant.</p>
<p>Temperature changes in polar deserts frequently
cross the freezing point of water. This &ldquo;freeze-thaw&rdquo;
alternation forms patterned textures on the
ground, as much as 5 meters in diameter.</p>

</div>
<p>Data on ancient sand seas (vast regions of
sand dunes), changing lake basins, archaeology,
and vegetation analyses indicate that climatic
conditions have changed considerably over vast
areas of the Earth in the recent geologic past.
During the last 12,500 years, for example, parts
of the deserts were more arid than they are today.
About 10 percent of the land between 30&deg;
N. and 30&deg; S. is covered now by sand seas.
Nearly 18,000 years ago, sand seas in two vast
belts occupied almost 50 percent of this land
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
area. As is the case today, tropical rain forests
and savannahs were between the two belts.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">A dry community of vegetation grows among the dunes of the Nebraska Sand Hills (<i>photograph by N. H. Darton</i>).</span></p>
</div>
<p>Fossil desert sediments that are as much as
500 million years old have been found in many
parts of the world. Sand dune-like patterns have
been recognized in presently nonarid environments.
Many such relict dunes now receive from
80 to 150 millimeters of rain each year. Some
ancient dunes are in areas now occupied by
tropical rain forests.</p>
<p>The Nebraska Sand Hills is an inactive 57,000-square
kilometer dune field in central Nebraska.
The largest sand sea in the Western Hemisphere,
it is now stabilized by vegetation and receives
about 500 millimeters of rain each year. Dunes in
the Sand Hills are up to 120 meters high.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h3 id="c12">Extraterrestrial deserts</h3>
<p>Mars is the only other planet on which we
have identified wind-shaped (<i>eolian</i>) features.
Although its surface atmospheric pressure is only
about one-hundredth that of Earth, global circulation
patterns on Mars have formed a circumpolar
sand sea of more than five million square
kilometers, an area greater than the Empty Quarter
of Saudi Arabia, the largest sand sea on our
planet. Martian sand seas consist predominantly
of crescent-shaped dunes on plains near the perennial
ice cap of the north polar area. Smaller
dune fields occupy the floors of many large
craters in the polar regions.</p>

<h2 id="c13"><br /><span class="small">Desert Features</span></h2>
<p>Sand covers only about 20 percent of the
Earth&rsquo;s deserts. Most of the sand is in
sand sheets and sand seas&mdash;vast regions
of undulating dunes resembling ocean
waves &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; in an instant of time.</p>
<p>Nearly 50 percent of desert surfaces are plains
where eolian deflation&mdash;removal of fine-grained
material by the wind&mdash;has exposed loose gravels
consisting predominantly of pebbles but with occasional
cobbles.</p>
<p>The remaining surfaces of arid lands are composed
of exposed bedrock outcrops, desert soils,
and fluvial deposits including alluvial fans, playas,
desert lakes, and oases. Bedrock outcrops commonly
occur as small mountains surrounded by
extensive erosional plains.</p>
<p>Oases are vegetated areas moistened by
springs, wells, or by irrigation. Many are artificial.
Oases are often the only places in deserts that
support crops and permanent habitation.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h3 id="c14">Soils</h3>
<p>Soils that form in arid climates are predominantly
mineral soils with low organic content.
The repeated accumulation of water in some
soils causes distinct salt layers to form. Calcium
carbonate precipitated from solution may cement
sand and gravel into hard layers called &ldquo;calcrete&rdquo;
that form layers up to 50 meters thick.</p>
<p>Caliche is a reddish-brown to white layer found
in many desert soils. Caliche commonly occurs
as nodules or as coatings on mineral grains
formed by the complicated interaction between
water and carbon dioxide released by plant roots
or by decaying organic material.</p>
<h3 id="c15">Plants</h3>
<p>Most desert plants are drought- or salt-tolerant.
Some store water in their leaves, roots, and
stems. Other desert plants have long tap roots
that penetrate the water table, anchor the soil,
and control erosion. The stems and leaves of
some plants lower the surface velocity of sand-carrying
winds and protect the ground from
erosion.</p>

</div>
<p>Deserts typically have a plant cover that is
sparse but enormously diverse. The Sonoran
Desert of the American Southwest has the most
complex desert vegetation on Earth. The giant
saguaro cacti provide nests for desert birds and
serve as &ldquo;trees&rdquo; of the desert. Saguaro grow
slowly but may live 200 years. When 9 years old,
they are about 15 centimeters high. After about
75 years, the cacti are tall and develop their first
branches. When fully grown, saguaro are 15
meters tall and weigh as much as 10 tons. They
dot the Sonoran and reinforce the general impression
of deserts as cacti-rich land.</p>
<p>Although cacti are often thought of as characteristic
desert plants, other types of plants have
adapted well to the arid environment. They include
the pea family and sunflower family. Cold
deserts have grasses and shrubs as dominant
vegetation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h3 id="c16">Water</h3>
<p>Rain does fall occasionally in deserts, and
desert storms are often violent. A record 44
millimeters of rain once fell within 3 hours in the
Sahara. Large Saharan storms may deliver up to
1 millimeter per minute. Normally dry stream
channels, called arroyos or wadis, can quickly fill
after heavy rains, and flash floods make these
channels dangerous. More people drown in
deserts than die of thirst.</p>
<p>Though little rain falls in deserts, deserts
receive runoff from ephemeral, or short-lived,
streams fed by rain and snow from adjacent
highlands. These streams fill the channel with a
slurry of mud and commonly transport considerable
quantities of sediment for a day or two. Although
most deserts are in basins with closed,
or interior drainage, a few deserts are crossed
by &lsquo;exotic&rsquo; rivers that derive their water from outside
the desert. Such rivers infiltrate soils and
evaporate large amounts of water on their
journeys through the deserts, but their volumes
are such that they maintain their continuity. The
Nile, the Colorado, and the Yellow are exotic
rivers that flow through deserts to deliver their
sediments to the sea.</p>

</div>
<p>Lakes form where rainfall or meltwater in interior
drainage basins is sufficient. Desert lakes
are generally shallow, temporary, and salty. Because
these lakes are shallow and have a low
bottom gradient, wind stress may cause the lake
waters to move over many square kilometers.
When small lakes dry up, they leave a salt crust
or hardpan. The flat area of clay, silt, or sand
encrusted with salt that forms is known as a
<i>playa</i>. There are more than a hundred playas in
North American deserts. Most are relics of large
lakes that existed during the last Ice Age about
12,000 years ago. Lake Bonneville was a
52,000-square-kilometer lake almost 300 meters
deep in Utah, Nevada, and Idaho during the Ice
Age. Today the remnants of Lake Bonneville include
Utah&rsquo;s Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, and
Sevier Lake. Because playas are arid land forms
from a wetter past, they contain useful clues to
climatic change.</p>
<p>The flat terrains of hardpans and playas make
them excellent race tracks and natural runways
for airplanes and spacecraft. Ground-vehicle
speed records are commonly established on Bonneville
Speedway, a race track on the Great Salt
Lake hardpan. Space shuttles land on Rogers
Lake Playa at Edwards Air Force Base, California.</p>

<h2 id="c17"><br /><span class="small">Eolian Processes</span></h2>
<p>Eolian processes pertain to the activity of
the winds. Winds may erode, transport,
and deposit materials, and are effective
agents in regions with sparse vegetation and a
large supply of unconsolidated sediments.
Although water is much more powerful than
wind, eolian processes are important in arid
environments.</p>
<h3 id="c18">Eolian erosion</h3>
<p>Wind erodes the Earth&rsquo;s surface by deflation,
the removal of loose, fine-grained particles by
the turbulent eddy action of the wind, and by
abrasion, the wearing down of surfaces by the
grinding action and sand blasting of windborne
particles.</p>
<p>Most eolian deflation zones are composed of
<i>desert pavement</i>, a sheetlike surface of rock
fragments that remains after wind and water
have removed the fine particles. Almost half of
the Earth&rsquo;s desert surfaces are stony deflation
zones. The rock mantle in desert pavements protects
the underlying material from deflation.</p>

</div>
<p>A dark, shiny stain, called <i>desert varnish</i> or
rock varnish, is often found on surfaces of some
desert rocks that have been exposed at the surface
for a long period of time. Manganese, iron
oxides, hydroxides, and clay minerals form most
varnishes and provide the shine.</p>
<p>Deflation basins, called <i>blowouts</i>, are hollows
formed by the removal of particles by wind. Blowouts
are generally small, but may be up to several
kilometers in diameter.</p>
<p>Wind-driven grains abrade landforms. Grinding
by particles carried in the wind creates grooves
or small depressions. <i>Ventifacts</i> are rocks which
have been cut, and sometimes polished, by the
abrasive action of wind.</p>
<p>Sculpted landforms, called <i>yardangs</i>, are up to
tens of meters high and kilometers long and are
forms that have been streamlined by desert
winds. The famous sphinx at Giza in Egypt may
be a modified yardang.</p>

<h3 id="c19">Eolian transportation</h3>
<p>Particles are transported by winds through
suspension, saltation, and creep.</p>
<p>Small particles may be held in the atmosphere
in <i>suspension</i>. Upward currents of air support the
weight of suspended particles and hold them indefinitely
in the surrounding air. Typical winds
near the Earth&rsquo;s surface suspend particles less
than 0.2 millimeters in diameter and scatter them
aloft as dust or haze.</p>
<p><i>Saltation</i> is downwind movement of particles in
a series of jumps or skips. Saltation normally lifts
sand-size particles no more than one centimeter
above the ground, and proceeds at one-half to
one-third the speed of the wind. A saltating grain
may hit other grains that jump up to continue the
saltation. The grain may also hit larger grains
that are too heavy to hop, but that slowly <i>creep</i>
forward as they are pushed by saltating grains.
Surface creep accounts for as much as 25 percent
of grain movement in a desert.</p>
<p>Eolian turbidity currents are better known as
<i>dust storms</i>. Air over deserts is cooled significantly
when rain passes through it. This cooler
and denser air sinks toward the desert surface.
When it reaches the ground, the air is deflected
forward and sweeps up surface debris in its turbulence
as a dust storm.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_35">

</div>
<p>Crops, people, villages, and possibly even climates
are affected by dust storms. Some dust
storms are intercontinental, a few may circle the
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
globe, and occasionally they may engulf entire
planets. When the Mariner 9 spacecraft arrived
at Mars in 1971, the entire planet was enshrouded
in global dust.</p>

<p>Most of the dust carried by dust storms is in
the form of silt-size particles. Deposits of this
windblown silt are known as <i>loess</i>. The thickest
known deposit of loess, 335 meters, is on the
Loess Plateau in China. In Europe and in the
Americas, accumulations of loess are generally
from 20 to 30 meters thick.</p>
<p>Small whirlwinds, called <i>dust devils</i>, are common
in arid lands and are thought to be related
to very intense local heating of the air that
results in instabilities of the air mass. Dust devils
may be as much as one kilometer high.</p>

<h3 id="c20">Eolian deposition</h3>
<p>Wind-deposited materials hold clues to past as
well as to present wind directions and intensities.
These features help us understand the present
climate and the forces that molded it. Wind-deposited
sand bodies occur as sand sheets, ripples,
and dunes.</p>
<p><i>Sand sheets</i> are flat, gently undulating sandy
plots of sand surfaced by grains that may be too
large for saltation. They form approximately 40
percent of eolian depositional surfaces. The
Selima Sand Sheet, which occupies 60,000
square kilometers in southern Egypt and northern
Sudan, is one of the Earth&rsquo;s largest sand sheets.
The Selima is absolutely flat in some places; in
others, active dunes move over its surface.</p>
<p>Wind blowing on a sand surface <i>ripples</i> the
surface into crests and troughs whose long axes
are perpendicular to the wind direction. The
average length of jumps during saltation corresponds
to the wavelength, or distance between
adjacent crests, of the ripples. In ripples, the
coarsest materials collect at the crests. This
distinguishes small ripples from dunes, where
the coarsest materials are generally in the
troughs.</p>

</div>
<p>Accumulations of sediment blown by the wind
into a mound or ridge, dunes have gentle upwind
slopes on the wind-facing side. The downwind
portion of the dune, the lee slope, is commonly a
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
steep avalanche slope referred to as a <i>slipface</i>.
Dunes may have more than one slipface. The
minimum height of a slipface is about 30
centimeters.</p>
<p>Sand grains move up the dune&rsquo;s gentle upwind
slope by saltation and creep. When particles
at the brink of the dune exceed the angle
of repose, they spill over in a tiny landslide or
avalanche that reforms the slipface. As the
avalanching continues, the dune moves in the
direction of the wind.</p>
<p>Some of the most significant experimental
measurements on eolian sand movement were
performed by Ralph Bagnold, a British engineer
who worked in Egypt prior to World War II.
Bagnold investigated the physics of particles
moving through the atmosphere and deposited
by wind. He recognized two basic dune types,
the crescentic dune, which he called &ldquo;barchan,&rdquo;
and the linear dune, which he called longitudinal
or &ldquo;sief&rdquo; (Arabic for &ldquo;sword&rdquo;).</p>

<h2 id="c21"><br /><span class="small">Types of Dunes</span></h2>
<p>A worldwide inventory of deserts has been
developed using images from the Landsat
satellites and from space and aerial
photography. It defines five basic types of dunes:
<i>crescentic</i>, <i>linear</i>, <i>star</i>, <i>dome</i>, and <i>parabolic</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_40">

<p class="caption"><span class="small">These crescentic dunes of coastal Peru are migrating toward the left (<i>photograph by John McCauley</i>).</span></p>
</div>
<p>The most common dune form on Earth and on
Mars is the <i>crescentic</i>. Crescent-shaped mounds
generally are wider than long. The slipface is on
the dune&rsquo;s concave side. These dunes form
under winds that blow from one direction, and
they also are known as barchans, or transverse
dunes. Some types of crescentic dunes move
faster over desert surfaces than any other type
of dune. A group of dunes moved more than 100
meters per year between 1954 and 1959 in
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
China&rsquo;s Ningxia Province; similar rates have been
recorded in the Western Desert of Egypt. The
largest crescentic dunes on Earth, with mean
crest-to-crest widths of more than 3 kilometers,
are in China&rsquo;s Taklimakan Desert.</p>
<p>Straight or slightly sinuous sand ridges typically
much longer than they are wide are known as
<i>linear dunes</i>. They may be more than 160 kilometers
long. Linear dunes may occur as isolated
ridges, but they generally form sets of parallel
ridges separated by miles of sand, gravel, or
rocky interdune corridors. Some linear dunes
merge to form Y-shaped compound dunes. Many
form in bidirectional wind regimes. The long axes
of these dunes extend in the resultant direction
of sand movement.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">Star dunes, such as these of the Namib, indicate the winds that formed them blew from many directions (<i>photograph by Georg Gerster</i>).</span></p>
</div>
<p>Radially symmetrical, <i>star dunes</i> are pyramidal
sand mounds with slipfaces on three or more
arms that radiate from the high center of the
mound. They tend to accumulate in areas with
multidirectional wind regimes. Star dunes grow
upward rather than laterally. They dominate the
Grand Erg Oriental of the Sahara. In other
deserts, they occur around the margins of the
sand seas, particularly near topographic barriers.
In the southeast Badain Jaran Desert of China,
the star dunes are up to 500 meters tall and may
be the tallest dunes on Earth.</p>

<p>Oval or circular mounds that generally lack a
slipface, <i>dome dunes</i> are rare and occur at the
far upwind margins of sand seas.</p>
<p>U-shaped mounds of sand with convex noses
trailed by elongated arms are <i>parabolic dunes</i>.
Sometimes these dunes are called U-shaped,
blowout, or hairpin dunes, and they are well
known in coastal deserts. Unlike crescentic
dunes, their crests point upwind. The elongated
arms of parabolic dunes follow rather than lead
because they have been fixed by vegetation,
while the bulk of the sand in the dune migrates
forward. The longest known parabolic dune has
a trailing arm 12 kilometers long.</p>

</div>
<p>Occurring wherever winds periodically reverse
direction, <i>reversing dunes</i> are varieties of any of
the above types. These dunes typically have major
and minor slipfaces oriented in opposite
directions.</p>
<p>All these dune types may occur in three forms:
<i>simple</i>, <i>compound</i>, and <i>complex</i>. Simple dunes
are basic forms with a minimum number of slipfaces
that define the geometric type. Compound
dunes are large dunes on which smaller dunes
of similar type and slipface orientation are
superimposed, and complex dunes are combinations
of two or more dune types. A crescentic
dune with a star dune superimposed on its crest
is the most common complex dune. Simple
dunes represent a wind regime that has not
changed in intensity or direction since the formation
of the dune, while compound and complex
dunes suggest that the intensity and direction of
the wind has changed.</p>

<h2 id="c22"><br /><span class="small">Remote Sensing of Arid Lands</span></h2>
<p>The world&rsquo;s deserts are generally remote,
inaccessible, and inhospitable. Hidden
among them, however, are hydrocarbon
reservoirs, evaporites, and other mineral deposits,
as well as human artifacts preserved for
centuries by the arid climate. In these harsh environments,
the information and perspective required
to increase our understanding of arid-land
geology and resources often depends on remote-sensing
methods. Remote sensing is the collection
of information about an object without being
in direct physical contact with it.</p>
<p>Remote-sensing instruments in Earth-orbit satellites
measure radar, visible light, and infrared radiation.
Radar imaging systems provide their own
source of electromagnetic energy, so they can
operate at any time of day or night. Additionally,
clouds and all but the most severe storms are
transparent to radar.</p>
<p>The first Shuttle Imaging Radar System (SIR-A),
flown on the U.S. space shuttle <i>Columbia</i> in
1981, recorded images that show buried fluvial
topography, faults, and intrusive bodies otherwise
concealed beneath sand sheets and dunes
of the Western Desert in Egypt and the Sudan.
Most of these features are not visible from the
ground. The radar signal penetrated loose dry
sands and returned images of buried river channels
not visible at the surface. These images
helped find new archeologic sites and sources of
potable water in the desert. These &ldquo;radar rivers&rdquo;
are the remnants of a now vanished major river
system that flowed across Africa some 20 million
years before the development of the Nile River
system. Radar imagery also is a powerful tool for
exploring for placer mineral deposits in arid lands.</p>
<p>In 1972, the United States launched the first of
a group of unmanned satellites collectively known
as Landsat. Landsat satellites carry sensors that
record &ldquo;light,&rdquo; or portions of the electromagnetic
spectrum, as it reflects off the Earth. Landsat acquires
digital data that are converted into an
image.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The scarcity of vegetation makes spectral
remote sensing especially effective in arid lands.
Rocks containing limonite, a hydrous iron oxide,
may be identified readily from Landsat Multispectral
Scanner data. The Landsat Thematic Mapper
(TM) has increased our ability to detect and map
the distribution of minerals in volcanic rocks and
related mineral deposits in arid and semiarid lands.</p>
<p>More than a million images of Earth have been
acquired by the Landsat satellites. A Landsat image
may be viewed as a single band in black-and-white,
or as a combination represented by
three colors, called a color composite. The most
widely used Landsat color image is called a false-color
composite because it reproduces the infrared
band (invisible to the naked eye) as red,
the red band as green, and the green band as
blue. Healthy vegetation in a false-color composite
is red.</p>
<p>Desert studies still are hampered in many
regions by lack of accurate climate data. Most
desert weather stations are in oases surrounded
by trees and buildings and have been subjected
to many location and elevation changes throughout
the life of the station. Data from oases do
not reflect conditions from the surrounding
desert. A wide variety of instruments has been
used to record measurements over varying
lengths of time and in different formats, making
data difficult to interpret and compare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>To overcome some of these problems in
deserts of the American Southwest, the U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) established its Desert
Winds Project to measure in a standard format
several key meteorologic characteristics of arid
lands. Project scientists have successfully
established instrument stations to measure wind-speed,
including peak gusts, which alter the
landforms the most. A station recorded a windstorm
near Vicksburg, Arizona, for example, with
peak gusts of almost 150 kilometers per hour.
Using low-maintenance, automatic, solar-powered
sensors, the stations also measure wind direction,
precipitation, humidity, soil and air temperatures,
and barometric pressure at specific
heights above the surface. Data are sampled at
6-minute intervals and transmitted every 30
minutes to a Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellite (GOES). From GOES, the data
are transmitted to the USGS laboratory in
Flagstaff, Arizona.</p>
<p>The Desert Winds Project&rsquo;s investigators combine
analyses of data with detailed geologic field
studies and repetitive remote-sensing coverage in
order to investigate and understand the long-term
changes produced by wind in deserts of differing
geologic and climatic types.</p>

<h2 id="c23"><br /><span class="small">Mineral Resources in Deserts</span></h2>
<p>Some mineral deposits are formed, improved,
or preserved by geologic processes that
occur in arid lands as a consequence of
climate. Ground water leaches ore minerals and
redeposits them in zones near the water table.
This leaching process concentrates these minerals
as ore that can be mined. Of the 15 major
types of mineral deposits in the Western Hemisphere
formed by action of ground water, 13 occur
in deserts.</p>
<p>Evaporation in arid lands enriches mineral accumulation
in their lakes. Playas may be sources
of mineral deposits formed by evaporation. Water
evaporating in closed basins precipitates minerals
such as gypsum, salts (including sodium nitrate
and sodium chloride), and borates. The
minerals formed in these evaporite deposits depend
on the composition and temperature of the
saline waters at the time of deposition.</p>
<p>Significant evaporite resources occur in the
Great Basin Desert of the United States, mineral
deposits made forever famous by the &ldquo;20-mule
teams&rdquo; that once hauled borax-laden wagons
from Death Valley to the railroad. Boron, from
borax and borate evaporites, is an essential ingredient
in the manufacture of glass, ceramics,
enamel, agricultural chemicals, water softeners,
and pharmaceuticals. Borates are mined from
evaporite deposits at Searles Lake, California,
and other desert locations. The total value of
chemicals that have been produced from Searles
Lake substantially exceeds $1 billion.</p>
<p>The Atacama Desert of South America is
unique among the deserts of the world in its
great abundance of saline minerals. Sodium nitrate
has been mined for explosives and fertilizer
in the Atacama since the middle of the 19th century.
Nearly 3 million metric tons were mined
during World War I.</p>
<p>Valuable minerals located in arid lands include
copper in the United States, Chile, Peru, and
Iran; iron and lead-zinc ore in Australia; chromite
in Turkey; and gold, silver, and uranium deposits
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
in Australia and the United States. Nonmetallic
mineral resources and rocks such as beryllium,
mica, lithium, clays, pumice, and scoria also occur
in arid regions. Sodium carbonate, sulfate,
borate, nitrate, lithium, bromine, iodine, calcium,
and strontium compounds come from sediments
and nearsurface brines formed by evaporation of
inland bodies of water, often during geologically
recent times.</p>

<p>Some of the more productive petroleum areas
on Earth are found in arid and semiarid regions
of Africa and the Mideast, although the oil reservoirs
were originally formed in shallow marine
environments. Recent climate change has placed
these reservoirs in an arid environment.</p>
<p>Other oil reservoirs, however, are presumed to
be eolian in origin and are presently found in
humid environments. The Rotliegendes, a hydrocarbon
reservoir in the North Sea, is associated
with extensive evaporite deposits. Many of the
major U.S. hydrocarbon resources may come
from eolian sands. Ancient alluvial fan sequences

<h2 id="c24"><br /><span class="small">Desertification</span></h2>
<p>The world&rsquo;s great deserts were formed by
natural processes interacting over long
intervals of time. During most of these
times, deserts have grown and shrunk independent
of human activities. Paleodeserts, large
sand seas now inactive because they are stabilized
by vegetation, extend well beyond the present
margins of core deserts, such as the Sahara.
In some regions, deserts are separated sharply
from surrounding, less arid areas by mountains
and other contrasting landforms that reflect basic
structural differences in the regional geology. In
other areas, desert fringes form a gradual transition
from a dry to a more humid environment,
making it more difficult to define the desert border.</p>

</div>
<p>These transition zones have very fragile, delicately
balanced ecosystems. Desert fringes often
are a mosaic of microclimates. Small hollows
support vegetation that picks up heat from the
hot winds and protects the land from the prevailing
winds. After rainfall the vegetated areas are
distinctly cooler than the surroundings. In these
marginal areas, human activity may stress the
ecosystem beyond its tolerance limit, resulting in
degradation of the land. By pounding the soil
with their hooves, livestock compact the substrate,
increase the proportion of fine material, and reduce
the percolation rate of the soil, thus encouraging
erosion by wind and water. Grazing
and the collection of firewood reduces or eliminates
plants that help to bind the soil.</p>
<p>This degradation of formerly productive land&mdash;<i>desertification</i>&mdash;is
a complex process. It involves
multiple causes, and it proceeds at varying rates
in different climates. Desertification may intensify
a general climatic trend toward greater aridity, or
it may initiate a change in local climate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Desertification does not occur in linear, easily
mappable patterns. Deserts advance erratically,
forming patches on their borders. Areas far from
natural deserts can degrade quickly to barren
soil, rock, or sand through poor land management.
The presence of a nearby desert has no
direct relationship to desertification. Unfortunately,
an area undergoing desertification is brought
to public attention only after the process is well
underway. Often little or no data are available to
indicate the previous state of the ecosystem or
the rate of degradation. Scientists still question
whether desertification, as a process of global
change, is permanent or how and when it can be
halted or reversed.</p>

<h3 id="c25">Problem</h3>
<p>Desertification became well known in the
1930&rsquo;s, when parts of the Great Plains in the
United States turned into the &ldquo;Dust Bowl&rdquo; as a
result of drought and poor practices in farming,
although the term itself was not used until almost
1950. During the dust bowl period, millions
of people were forced to abandon their farms
and livelihoods. Greatly improved methods of
agriculture and land and water management in
the Great Plains have prevented that disaster
from recurring, but desertification presently affects
millions of people in almost every continent.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">Off-road vehicles significantly increase soil loss in the delicate desert environment of the western United States. In a few seconds, soils that took hundreds of years to develop can be destroyed (<i>photograph by Terrence Moore</i>).</span></p>
</div>
<p>Increased population and livestock pressure on
marginal lands has accelerated desertification. In
some areas, nomads moving to less arid areas
disrupt the local ecosystem and increase the rate
of erosion of the land. Nomads are trying to escape
the desert, but because of their land-use
practices, they are bringing the desert with them.</p>
<p>It is a misconception that droughts cause
desertification. Droughts are common in arid and
semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover
from drought when the rains return. Continued
land abuse during droughts, however, increases
land degradation. By 1973, the drought that began
in 1968 in the Sahel of West Africa and the
land-use practices there had caused the deaths
of more than 100,000 people and 12 million cattle,
as well as the disruption of social organizations
from villages to the national level.</p>
<p>While desertification has received tremendous
publicity by the political and news media, there
are still many things that we don&rsquo;t know about
the degradation of productive lands and the expansion
of deserts. In 1988 Ridley Nelson
pointed out in an important scientific paper that
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
the desertification problem and processes are
not clearly defined. There is no consensus
among researchers as to the specific causes, extent,
or degree of desertification. Contrary to
many popular reports, desertification is actually a
subtle and complex process of deterioration that
may often be reversible.</p>

<h3 id="c26">Global monitoring</h3>
<p>In the last 25 years, satellites have begun to
provide the global monitoring necessary for improving
our understanding of desertification.
Landsat images of the same area, taken several
years apart but during the same point in the
growing season, may indicate changes in the
susceptibility of land to desertification. Studies
using Landsat data help demonstrate the impact
of people and animals on the Earth. However,
other types of remote-sensing systems, land-monitoring
networks, and global data bases of
field observations are needed before the process
and problems of desertification will be completely
understood.</p>
<h3 id="c27">Local remedies</h3>
<p>At the local level, individuals and governments
can help to reclaim and protect their lands. In
areas of sand dunes, covering the dunes with
large boulders or petroleum will interrupt the
wind regime near the face of the dunes and prevent
the sand from moving. Sand fences are
used throughout the Middle East and the United
States, in the same way snow fences are used in
the north. Placement of straw grids, each up to a
square meter in area, will also decrease the surface
wind velocity. Shrubs and trees planted
within the grids are protected by the straw until
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
they take root. In areas where some water is
available for irrigation, shrubs planted on the
lower one-third of a dune&rsquo;s windward side will
stabilize the dune. This vegetation decreases the
wind velocity near the base of the dune and
prevents much of the sand from moving. Higher
velocity winds at the top of the dune level it off
and trees can be planted atop these flattened
surfaces.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">Tengger Desert</span></p>
</div>
<p>Oases and farmlands in windy regions can be
protected by planting tree fences or grass belts.
Sand that manages to pass through the grass
belts can be caught in strips of trees planted as
wind breaks 50 to 100 meters apart adjacent to
the belts. Small plots of trees may also be scattered
inside oases to stabilize the area. On a
much larger scale, a &ldquo;Green Wall,&rdquo; which will
eventually stretch more than 5,700 kilometers in
length, much longer than the famous Great Wall,
is being planted in northeastern China to protect
&ldquo;sandy lands&rdquo;&mdash;deserts believed to have been
created by human activity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>More efficient use of existing water resources
and control of salinization are other effective
tools for improving arid lands. New ways are being
sought to use surface-water resources such
as rain water harvesting or irrigating with seasonal
runoff from adjacent highlands. New ways
are also being sought to find and tap groundwater
resources and to develop more effective
ways of irrigating arid and semiarid lands. Research
on the reclamation of deserts also is
focusing on discovering proper crop rotation to
protect the fragile soil, on understanding how
sand-fixing plants can be adapted to local environments,
and on how grazing lands and water
resources can be developed effectively without
being overused.</p>

</div>
<p>If we are to stop and reverse the degradation
of arid and semiarid lands, we must understand
how and why the rates of climate change, population
growth, and food production adversely affect
these environments. The most effective intervention
can come only from the wise use of
the best earth-science information available.</p>
